# OBSOLETE: In v19.2+, the List View's Batch Edit mode supports built-in lookup editors for reference properties. The custom code from this example is no longer required.


===========

# Reference properties and ImmediatePostData in ASPxGridView's Batch Edit mode

The demo project from this repository provides several navigation items demonstrating these improvements.

## Lookup editor for reference properties

This item illustrates a simple lookup.

## ImmediatePostData attribute in Batch Edit mode

This item illustrates how the [ImmediatePostData](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.Persistent.Base.ImmediatePostDataAttribute) attribute works in Batch Edit mode. ListView's calculated properties (FullName, BooleanPropertyAsString, SquaredNumberProperty) are updated immediately after changing values of other cells.

## Cascade Filtering for Lookup List Views

The item illustrates how to use [Cascade Filtering for Lookup List Views](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112681/Task-Based-Help/Filtering/How-to-Implement-Cascading-Filtering-for-Lookup-List-Views) in Batch Edit mode. The ListView has two lookup properties: Country and City. The City lookup items are populated based on the value selected in the Country lookup.

## Performance on Large Data Sources
This item shows how the lookup editor handles large data sources. The demonstrated lookup has 100,000 rows and [Server mode](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113683/Concepts/UI-Construction/Views/List-View-Data-Access-Modes) enabled in its model. This feature is available only in Batch Edit mode.
